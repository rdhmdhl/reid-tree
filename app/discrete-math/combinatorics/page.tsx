          Brilliant.org describes combinatorics well. They call it, the mathematics of counting and arranging. It applies mathematical operations to count quantities that are much too large to be counted the conventional way.

        <p className="text-sm font-thin mt-4">
          This is useful in computer science, as it can be used to develop estimates about how many operations a computer algorithm will require.

          An arragement is a way objects could be grouped, and the simpliest rules regarding arragements is the rule of product and sum. These rules govern how to count arrangements using the operations of multiplication and addition.

            How many integers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 7 or 13?

            It seems like the answer would be <InlineMath math={'7 + 14 = 21'}/>, however, this would be an error in double counting. One must consider that its possible for an integer to be divisible both by 7 and 14.

          <p className="text-sm font-thin mt-4">
          To account for the double counting, this amount is subtracted from the original answer of 21. That means there are 20 integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 7 or 13.

        Binomial Theorem

        <PascalTriangle/>
        <p className='mt-4'>
          This is called Pascal's Triangle. It's named after the 17th century French mathematician, Blaise Pascal (1623 - 1662). This triangle visualizes many properties of the binomial coefficient and the binomial theorem. Furthermore, its recursive nature and patterns are frequently found in dynamic programming, data structures, and even in optimization problems where understanding combinations and subsets is crucial.

        </p>
        <p className="text-sm font-thin mt-4">
          What is the coefficient of the <InlineMath math={'x^3y^{13}'}/> term in the polynomial expansion of <InlineMath math={'(x + y)^{16}'}/>
        </p>
        <p>We will use the binomial theorem to solve this.</p>
        <BlockMath math={'(x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k'}/>
        <p>In this case, <InlineMath math={'n = 16'}/>. We are looking for the term where <InlineMath math={'x'}/> has the power of 3, and <InlineMath math={'y'}/> has the power of 13. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This corresponds to <InlineMath math={'n - k = 3'}/> and <InlineMath math={'k = 13'}/> 
        </p>
        <p className='mt-4'>so, <InlineMath math={'k = 13'}/>.</p>
        <p className='mt-4'>
          The binomial coefficient <InlineMath math={'\\binom{n}{k}'}/> is given by:
        </p>
        <BlockMath math={'\\binom{16}{13} = \\binom{16}{3}'} />
        <p className='mt-4'>
          This is because <InlineMath math={'\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}'}/>.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-4'>
          Calculate <InlineMath math={'\\binom{16}{3}'}/>:
        </p>
        <BlockMath math={'\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!} = \\frac{16!}{3! \\cdot 13!}'} />
        <p>Simplifying this:</p>
        <BlockMath math={'\\binom{16}{3} ='}/>
        <BlockMath math={'\\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = '}/>
        <BlockMath math={'\\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{6} = 560'} />
        
        <p className='m-5'>
          Therefore, the coefficient of the <InlineMath math={'x^3 y^{13}'}/> term in the polynomial expansion of <InlineMath math={'(x + y)^{16}'}/> is 560.
